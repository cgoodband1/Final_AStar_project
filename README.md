# Final_AStar_project
Final project for Intro to AI
This project was create for Intro to Artifical Intelligence class during spring semster of 2020.
This project is an implentation of Astar greedy search algorithm. The environmnet can be either 100x100, 200x200 or 300x300 grid.
The density of the the obstacles can be 10%, 20% or 30%. 
Once you run the program you must first enter the grid size and the obstacle density(example .20 = 20%) into the command line. This will create the grid with the obstacles in a pygame GUI. The obstacles are randomly generated. 
Once the GUI opens to set the start point left click on a grid space. To set the end point right click on a grid space and then hit the space bar to find the path between the two points.
The time it took to find the path will be printed to the command line.
